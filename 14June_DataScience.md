# 14 June Data Science by Avishek Lahri 
## Emerging sector of Data Science 
### Retail sector 
- (recommdation system)-- content based --- when similar profile 
- ACM conference recomdation system (have free tutorials +workshops)
-PRICE OpTIMSATION (chnge price according to how people reacting wrt sales and price changes)
- INVENTORY MANAGMENT -(predict pattern of demand and supply ex in festive time like durga pooja kolkata have high demnad of rasgulla )
-Resources for optimsation (stephen  boyd stanford)
- HYPER PERSONALIXZED MARKETING - Walmart - changes according to each customer
- airport you are tracked  by wifi according to the location jaha aap presnt based on geo spatial position - shopping at airports 
- mining large cs246 resource 
- AR VR  in retail - 3d layout purchase sofa or shoes , ikea , facecake (earing), virtual tryon , 3D home tour property (Zillow)
- resources - andreas geinger tuingen (3d comp vision) then matthias niessner tu munich (IN2354)

### HEALTH ANALYSIS 
- google fitbit (smart waerable )
- heart rate , sleep pattern spo2 body temp walking and workout pattern fatigue level 
- based on that we can give solutions and share with doctors 
- apple watch by ecg finger on screen and in case of anamoly report to doct ----(ANAMOLY DETECTION)
- amazon halo - audio , signal prrocessing -- mood 
- amazon halo - percentage of body weight by scnning you - body fat %age 
- fitbit 
- RESources - ap[lied time series analysis (nptel)---
- signal prcess - sc dutta roy iitd electronics didgital signal processing 
- brad osgood (fourier transform) ee 261 stanford 

### GRAPHS 
- food dicovery by uber 
- pintrust graph neural network recomdation
- twitter uses graph to predict fake and real as they have different way of propogation( diff graph)
- nuetrino dicovry - nuetrino observatory - graph neural network for iceCube signal classifiction
- drug and medicine discovery (molecules as graph and where are they found in fruit)
- multiple medicine and relation graph (mol of medicine in graph and whetther mol in 2 med will interact or not)
- anitbiotic discoevery (molecular structure se dekhna about prop )
- AlphaFold - 50 year old prob (3d arrang of protien in space  by graph)(gradient decesnt)--(help in detecting protein structure and hence help in making antibiotics coviud)
- CS224 Machine learnoing with graph 

##ATMOSPHERIC MODELLING 
- Google ai blog (neural wather model)(no need of physic - use radar and images from geostation and predict future weather )-- DEep learning (tpus)(more accurate )
- NOWCASTING - local immediate 1-3 hour forecasting (wrt 6 hour by traditional )

### FRAUD DETECTION ONLINE 
- amazon- anamoly detection problem 
- abuse - uber swiggy flikart 
- farud - with high accuracy based on activity 
- e commerce abuse detection 
- RESOURCES - Clustering , hasing 
---(CS294 DEEP UNSUPERVISED LEARNING SPRING 2020), semi supervised learning 
- It encounter most non fraud data 

### AGRICULTURE 
- dRONES for targetted space of pesticides 
- wipro ai in agricultur
- right time to sow seed 
- intelligent spray of chem based on areas which need it 
- monitor soil humidiy by sensors 
- need anaysis 
- startup--(PROSPERA - pest an diseases detection water and )
- harvest croo (straberry pluckiing by picking right starwberry
- indian CROPIN 
- GRAMAPHONe- (e commerce btn framer and trader )
- microsift Farm Beats - AI edge and iot 2015

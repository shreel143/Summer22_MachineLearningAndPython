# 14 June Data Science by Avishek Lahri 
## Emerging sector of Data Science 
### Retail sector 
- (recommendation system)—content-based --- when similar profile 
- ACM conference recommendation system (have free tutorials +workshops)
-PRICE optimization (change price according to how people react w.r.t sales and price changes)
- INVENTORY MANAGEMENT -(predict the pattern of demand and supply ex in festive time like Durga pooja Kolkata have high demand of rasgulla )
-Resources for optimization (Stephen  Boyd Stanford)
- HYPER PERSONALIZED MARKETING - Walmart - changes according to each customer
- the airport you are tracked  by WIFI according to the location Jaha aap present based on geospatial position - shopping at airports 
- mining large cs246 resource 
- AR VR  in retail - 3d layout purchase sofa or shoes, IKEA , face cake (earing), virtual Tryon , 3D home tour property (Zillow)
- resources - andreas geinger tuingen (3d comp vision) then matthias niessner tu munich (IN2354)

### HEALTH ANALYSIS 
- google Fitbit (smart wearable )
- heart rate, sleep pattern spo2 body temp walking and workout pattern fatigue level 
- based on that we can give solutions and share them with doctors 
- apple watch by ECG finger on the screen and in case of anomaly report to doct ----(ANAMOLY DETECTION)
- amazon halo - audio , signal processing -- mood 
- amazon halo - percentage of body weight by scanning you - body fat %age 
- Fitbit 
- Resources - ap[lied time series analysis (nptel)---
- signal process - SC Dutta Roy iitd electronics digital signal processing 
- brad Osgood (Fourier transform) ee 261 Stanford 

### GRAPHS 
- food discovery by uber 
- pintrust graph neural network recommendation
- twitter uses graph to predict fake and real as they have different way of propagation( diff graph)
- neutrino discovery - neutrino observatory - graph neural network for ice Cube signal classification
- drug and medicine discovery (molecules as graph and where are they found in fruit)
- multiple medicine and relation graph (mol of medicine in graph and whether mol in 2 med will interact or not)
- antibiotic discovery (molecular structure se dekhna about prop )
- Alpha Fold - 50-year-old prob (3d arrange of protein in space  by graph)(gradient descent)--(help in detecting protein structure and hence help in making antibiotics Covid)
- CS224 Machine learning with graph 

## ATMOSPHERIC MODELLING 
- Google ai blog (neural weather model)(no need of physic - use radar and images from geostation and predict future weather )-- Deep learning (tpus)(more accurate )
- NOWCASTING - local immediate 1–3-hour forecasting (wrt 6 hour by traditional )

### FRAUD DETECTION ONLINE 
- amazon- anomaly detection problem 
- abuse - uber swiggy flikart 
- fraud - with high accuracy based on activity 
- e-commerce abuse detection 
- RESOURCES - Clustering, hashing 
---(CS294 DEEP UNSUPERVISED LEARNING SPRING 2020), semi-supervised learning 
- It encounters most non-fraud data 

### AGRICULTURE 
- drones for targeted space of pesticides 
- Wipro ai in agriculture
- right time to sow seed 
- the intelligent spray of chem based on areas which need it 
- monitor soil humidity by sensors 
- need analysis 
- start-up--(PROSPERA - pest a diseases detection water and )
- harvest croo (strawberry plucking by picking the right strawberry
- Indian CROPIN 
- Gramophone- (e commerce between framer and trader )
- Microsoft Farm Beats - AI edge and IOT 2015
